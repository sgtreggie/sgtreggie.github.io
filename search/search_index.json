It is how Nintendo keeps save data, games, DSiWare exports, etc. exclusive to the console they came from. This file is present on CTRNAND in the private folder. It is 320 bytes (with CMAC) or 288 bytes (without CMAC). The movable is constructed of the following; - The \"SEED\" magic at the start of the file - A 'flag' to indicate the presence of a CMAC(?) - If this is set to 01, the 3DS will expect a CMAC to be at the end of the file. If it isn't there, it will not boot. - LocalFriendCodeSeed_B (copied from CTRNAND/rw/sys) - The \"keyY\", or the actual 'encryption key' part of the file - A CMAC From my testing, a 3DS will not boot if this file is empty or improperly formatted. The following is required for booting; - The \"SEED\" magic at the start of the file - The \"keyY\", or the actual 'encryption key' part of the file - This configuration of the file is the bare minimum and will allow a console to boot.
